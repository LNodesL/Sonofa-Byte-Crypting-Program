# SonofaByteCryptingProgram Source

Included is the SonofaByteCryptingProgram.cpp (crypter), Egg.cpp (original stub), Hatchling.h (the bytes array header include of compiled Egg.exe).

## SonofaByteCryptingProgram.cpp

This is the main crypter file that includes the Hatchling.h file include and all needed logic to replace a resource for future crypts to replace the program that is executed in runtime.

## Hatchling.h

Generated by utils/BTCH as a header file include containing the bytes data for tmp/Egg.exe

## Egg.cpp

The original stub file that has all logic for executing a binary in runtime. Is used to compile the tmp/Egg.exe for the build process.

## helloworld.cpp

Simple test file to compile into a PE to test the crypter (SonofaByteCryptingProgram.exe) by dragging & dropping helloworld onto the crypter, or by CLI.

## include/

This folder contains a basic Compile-time encryption & run-time decryption class that is prototyped in the helloworld program.

```
g++ source/programs/helloworld/helloworld.cpp -static -o dist/helloworld.exe -mwindows
```

## The son of two

SonofaByteCryptingProgram is the result of the merging of EspanaKrypt and CryptDemo, with enhancements made.
